# Oh, My Trees
**Oh, My Trees** (`ohmt`) is a library for hyperplane-based Decision Tree induction, which allows you to induce
both Univariate (e.g., CART, C4.5) and Multivariate (OC1, Geometric) Decision Trees.
It currently supports single-class classification trees, and does not support categorical variables as they don't play
well with hyperplanes.

# Quickstart
## Installation
Installation through git:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/msetzu/oh-my-trees
mkvirtualenv -p python3.11 omt  # optional, creates virtual environment

cd oh-my-trees
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```
or directly through `pip`:
```shell
pip install ohmt
```

## Training trees
OMT follows the classic sklearn `fit`/`predict` interface.  
You can find a full example in the examples notebook `notebooks/examples.ipynb`.

```python
from ohmt.trees.multivariate import OmnivariateDT

dt = OmnivariateDT()
x = ...
y = ...

# trees all follow a similar sklearn-like training interface, with max_depth, min_samples, and min_eps as available parameters
dt.fit(x, y, max_depth=4)
```

OMT also offers a pruning toolkit, handled by `trees.pruning.Gardener`, which allows you to prune the inducted Tree.
Find out more in the example notebook.

## Induction algorithms
`OMT` offers several Tree induction algorithms

## Using Trees
You can get an explicit view of a `tree` by accessing:
- `tree.nodes: Dict[int, Node]` its nodes,
- `tree.parent: Dict[int, int], tree.ancestors: Dict[int, List[int]]` its parent and ancestors,
- `tree.descendants: Dict[int, List[int]` its descendants,
- `tree.depth: Dict[int, int]`: the depth of its nodes.

`Tree`s can also be JSONized:
```python
tree.json()
```

## Growing your own `Tree`
Greedy trees follow the basic algorithmic core of
- learning step: induce a node
- if shall continue:
  - generate two children
  - recurse on the given children

We incorporate this algorithm in `Tree`, where `step` implements the node induction, thus, most greedy induction
algorithms can implemented by simply overriding the `step` function:
```python
    def step(self, parent_node: Optional[InternalNode],
             data: numpy.ndarray, labels: numpy.ndarray, classes: numpy.ndarray,
             direction: Optional[str] = None, depth: int = 1,
             min_eps: float = 0.000001, max_depth: int = 16, min_samples: int = 10,
             node_fitness_function: Optional[Callable] = None,
             node_hyperparameters: Optional[Dict] = None, **step_hyperparameters) -> Optional[Node]
```
